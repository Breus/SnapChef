# SnapChef - When cooking is not a hobby

SnapChef isn’t just another recipe book app, instead it’s designed for real life. Whether you don’t enjoy cooking,
quickly want to prepare a healthy meal, or simply don’t have time to cook as a hobby, SnapChef helps you get meals on
the table quickly, healthy, and stress-free. The focus is on simplicity, speed, and practicality for daily cooking and
grocery shopping.

## Features

* Easily create and manage your personal recipes
* Favorite recipes can be marked for quick access
* Responsive design for use on mobile devices in the kitchen
* Simple and clean user interface designed for daily use

## Future Features Ideas

* A user can select what they crave, e.g. “something with rice, chicken, …” and all matching recipes will be shown
* A user can easily extract and share the recipe's ingredient list with someone via WhatsApp for grocery shopping.
  Ideally the recipient can then directly import the ingredients into their own shopping list in Quicook.
